Unicode::Time - Display time using Unicode clock characters

SYNOPSIS
========

    use Unicode::Time;
    say now.DateTime.truncated-to <minute>;
    # > 2018-11-03T16:57:00Z
    say unitime now;
    # > ðŸ•”  [CLOCK FACE FIVE OCLOCK]
    say unitime now, round => Unicode::Time::Down;
    # > ðŸ•Ÿ  [CLOCK FACE FOUR-THIRTY]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Approximate a `DateTime`'s time with a Unicode clock character with the `unitime` sub, which is exported by default. Unicode clock characters have half-hour precision (currently?). `unitime` takes a `DateTime` and optionally a `Unicode::Time::Round` rounding mode.

### enum Round

```perl6
enum Round <Up Down Closest>;
```

Rounding modes for `unitime`'s `round` parameter.

### sub unitime

```perl6
sub unitime(
    DateTime:D() $dt,
    Round :$round = Round::Closest
) returns Str
```

Return a Unicode clock character that approximately represents the time component of the given DateTime. There is one character for every half-hour of an analogue clock, 24 in total. They start at `U+1F550` (&#x1F550;). The mapping from non-half-hours to half-hours is specified via the `round` parameter which defaults to `Closest`.

CAVEATS
=======

This module should be updated as Unicode inevitably adds codepoints for all the other handle configurations of the clock.
